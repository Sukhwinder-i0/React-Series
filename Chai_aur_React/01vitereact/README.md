# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


#
Components names(function) should be start from Capital letter in Both Raext and vite. like : Chai()

js / jsx:  error(depends upon libraries)

if html is getting return : use .jsx by convention

Best Practice to name file name with Capital but it will not throw error. like: Demo.js
